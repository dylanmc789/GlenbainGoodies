### Ingredients

* 1 Cup powdered milk
* ½ Cup Canola oil Or (¼ Lb. lard)
* 1 Cup Sugar
* 2 Tsp. Salt
* 4 Cups water

Bring the above ingredients to a boil. Add 4 more cups of cold water and let cool.

Yeast:

* 1 Cup Luke warm water

* 1 Tbsp. sugar

* 2 Tbsp. yeast

Mix the above 3 ingredients in a glass bowl and let stand for 10 minutes.

### Instructions

Put 20 cups of flour into a large bowl. (I start with 14 and add more as needed after liquid is added.) When yeast is ready mix with other wet ingredients and pour over flour mix while adding more flour as necessary for right consistency. Knead for 5 Min. and let rise. When dough has doubled in size punch down and cut and form into 10 big buns, let rise for 20 Min. Roll each bun out with a rolling pin stretching the dough flat, roll back up pinch the ends and place in a loaf pan. \*Then take a fork and poke the bread loafs to get rid of any air bubbles.\* Let rise to double in size, cook at 400 Degrees in a pre-heated oven for 10 min and then at 350 Degrees for 25- 30 min. Cook until golden brown. Butter tops and cool out of pans on a rack.
