### Ingredients

* 1/2 cup yellow cornmeal
* 1 cup all purpose flour
* 1 teaspoon baking powder
* 1/2 teaspoon salt
* 1 1/4 cup grated cheddar cheese divided
* 6 or 8 strips bacon cooked to almost crisp and crumbled
* 1 Green Pepper (diced)
* 1 cup Buttermilk
* 1/4 cup vegetable oil
* 1 large egg
* 1/2 teaspoon Hot sauce

### Instructions

Preheat your oven to 375 degrees Fahrenheit.

Grease a 12-cup muffin tin well with butter and set aside.

In a large bowl, whisk together the cornmeal, flour, baking powder and salt. Add 1 cup of the grated cheese (reserve 1/4 cup for topping the muffins before baking), diced green pepper, and the crumbled bacon and stir into the dry ingredients until combined.

In a large glass measuring cup, measure the milk and vegetable oil. Add the egg and hot sauce and whisk together to combine.

Add the wet ingredients to the dry ingredients and stir together just until no streaks of flour appear.Divide the batter evenly between the 12 prepared muffin cups and top with the remaining 1/4 cup grated cheddar cheese. Bake for 15-20 minutes at 375 degrees F or until the tops are slightly golden brown, the cheese is browned and bubbly, and the muffins are baked through (test with a toothpick).

Let cool in the muffin tin for about 5-10 minutes until removing the muffins to a wire rack to cool completely, or serve slightly warm with some butter and your favourite soup or stew.
