* 1 tbsp. Granulated sugar
* 2 tbsp. Cooking oil
* 1 tbsp. Baking powder
* 1 ½ cups milk

### Instructions

Combine flour, sugar, baking powder, and salt in medium size bowl. Beat egg slightly in small bowl. Mix in oil and milk. Add to dry ingredients. Stir. A few small lumps in batter are preferable. Add more or less milk to have thicker or thinner pancakes. Pan is really when drops of water bounce all over it. Drop batter by spoonful onto lightly greased hot pan 380 F. When bubbles appear and edges begin to dry, turn to brown other side. Serve hot with butter and maple syrup. Makes about 12. (optional fold in ¾ - 1 cup blueberries).
