Meanwhile Put 14 cups of flour into a big bowl (I always start with 11 and add to get 14 as I mix). When yeast is ready pour into milk mixture. Then pour everything over flour. Knead and let rise. Punch down and let rise again, cut into buns. Place buns on greased pans and let rise again. Preheat oven to 365 F and cook buns for 25 minutes. Then place on cooling racks and butter well.
