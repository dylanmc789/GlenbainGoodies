### Ingredients

* 1 lb. ground beef
* 1 large can beans
* 1 onion
* 1 can tomato soup
* ½ cup bread crumbs
* 4 potatoes (sliced thinly)
* 1 egg
* 2 cups frozen peas

### Instructions

Mix first 4 ingredients in a casserole dish, leave some space around the sides when you pat it down. Place sliced potatoes over and around meat. Mix beans and soup together and pour over meat and potatoes. Peas maybe placed on top right away or placed on later so they don’t dry out. Bake casserole at 350° for 1 ½ hours. If peas are added after baking, put back in oven for 10 minutes or so. Casserole is usually done when potatoes are soft.
