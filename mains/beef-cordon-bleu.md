### Ingredients

* 2 lbs ground beef
* Bacon or ham slices (slightly cooked)
* 4 Eggs
* Mozzarella Swiss or cheese slices

### Instructions

Mix beef, 2 eggs, 4 tbsps. onion soup mix, Salt & Pepper to taste and oats. Shape into paddies approx. 3”in diameter. Place a strip of bacon or ham and a strip of cheese in center. Roll like a jelly roll, sealing the ends so no cheese or meat are showing. Beat 2 eggs and roll each hamburger into it, then coat with bread crumbs. Fry in hot oil until browned. Bake in oven for 1 hour or until cooked through. Mix and heat mushroom soup & 1 can of milk, Salt & pepper to taste and 2-4 tbsp. onion soup mix. Pour over rolls and serve. (if gravy is too thick add more milk)
