* 1 Cup Ketchup
* 2/3 Cup Vinegar
* 1 Cup Boiling Water
* 2 Tsp. Dry Mustard

### Instructions

Brown pork chops and place in a baking dish. Mix all of the ingredients in a saucepan and bring to a boil. Pour the sauce over the pork chops. Cover and cook on low heat in a fry pan for 30-40 minutes or put in the oven at 350 F. This recipe makes enough sauce for about 6 pork chops. (It can also be used to make beef ribs).
