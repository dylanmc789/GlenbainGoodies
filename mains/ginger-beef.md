### Ingredients

Mix together:

* ¾ cup cornstarch
* ½ cup water
* 2 eggs

Cut 1 lb steak into thin strips dip into mixture above and either deep fry or fry pieces of steak.

Mix together:

* ½ cup sugar
* ¼ cup minced fresh ginger root
* 5 garlic cloves minced
* ¼ cup vinegar (rice vinegar)
* 3 tbsp soy sauce
* 1 tsp red Chili pepper flakes

To thicken add 3 Tsp’s. of cornstarch mixed with 3 Tsps. of Sugar, pour into mixture.

Option: can add ½ cup teriyaki sauce, honey garlic or sweet chili sauce.

Cut veggies the size of match sticks:

* 2 large carrots
* 1 green bell pepper
* 1 red bell pepper
* 3 green onions chopped
* 4 sticks celery

### Instructions

Cook slowly in a large fry pan for about 10 min. with 3 Tbsp’s. canola oil (or as needed) Pour sauce over steak strips, mix well then pour steak strips & sauce over the cooked vegetables.

**Note:** The vegetables don’t take very long to cook & they get soggy quick.  I double this recipe but be careful of adding too much fresh ginger and red chili peppers, only add enough to taste as it can get strong.
