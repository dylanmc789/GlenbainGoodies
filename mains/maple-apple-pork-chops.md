### Ingredients

* 6 boneless pork chops, 1/2 inch thick
* 2 Tablespoons olive oil
* 2 Tablespoons butter
* 2 Granny smith apples, (pealed & diced)
* 1/2 cup chicken broth
* 2 Teaspoons Lemon juice
* 3/4 cup pure maple syrup (can use honey and a splash of maple extract if you don’t have maple syrup)
* pinch of salt
* ground pepper to taste

### Instructions

Place the butter and olive oil in a large saute pan over medium heat. Heat until butter has melted. Salt and pepper both sides of the boneless pork chops and place them in the saute pan. Cook the pork chops , flipping when necessary until both sides are golden brown. Remove them from the pan to a roaster or baking dish.

Add the apples to the pan, stir to combine them with the oil and butter in the pan. Pour in the chicken broth and lemon juice. Whisk along the bottom of the pan to deglaze it. Add the maple syrup and a dash of salt and pepper to the pan, and let simmer for 5 minutes. Then pour the sauce mixture over the pork chops, cover and bake in the oven at 325 for 45 minutes to 1 hour.
