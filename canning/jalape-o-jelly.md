### Ingredients

* 3 Green Bell Peppers (seeded)
* 6 Jalapeno Peppers (with seeds)
* 1 1/2 Cups White Vinegar
* 6 1/2 Cups White Sugar
* 1/2-1 Tsp. Cayenne Pepper
* 2 Pouches Liquid Pectin (each pouch 3 oz's/ 85 ML)
* 4-6 Drops Green Food Coloring

### Instructions

Chop all peppers finely and combine with vinegar, sugar, cayenne pepper, and food coloring in a large pot. Cooking over medium heat. Stir frequently until mixture begins to boil. Boil for 10 minutes, stirring constantly. Add pectin and boil for 1 minute longer, without stirring. Remove from heat and skim off foam. Ladle into hot sterilized jars, leaving 1/2 an inch head-space, wipe rims and seal. Process in a water bath for 10 minutes. refrigerate any jars that did not seal. Makes roughly 7 small jars of jelly.

\* Sometimes the jelly may seem like it didn't set (look runny) however if you put it in the fridge it will firm up.
