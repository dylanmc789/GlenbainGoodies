### Ingredients

* 1/2 Cup Almonds (Sliced or slivered)
* 1/2 Cup Cashews
* 2 Tbsp. Sesame seeds
* 1 Bag of 3 color deli coleslaw mix (or 1/2 a head of cabbage shredded)
* 1/4 Cup Sunflower Seeds
* 1/4 Cup Hempseed (optional)
* 1 (3oz) Pkg. Instant noodles
* 1 Cup Chow Mein Noodles

### Instructions

On a cookie sheet toast your almonds, cashews, and sesame seeds in the oven at 350 F for about 5 minutes or until golden brown. Remove from the oven and set aside to cool. In a large bowl place your washed cabbage, sunflower seeds, and hempseed. Crush your instant noodles (save the seasoning packet for the dressing) and add to the cabbage along with your chow Mein noodles. Add in your toasted nuts once they have cooled.

# Dressing

### Ingredients

* 1 Pkg. Seasoning from the instant noodles
* 1/2 Cup Olive oil or Vegetable oil
* 4 Tbsp. Soy Sauce
* 3 Tbsp. Vinegar
* 1 Tbsp. White Sugar
* 1/2 Tsp. Pepper

### Instructions

In a glass jar combine the above ingredients and shake/stir until the sugar and seasoning have dissolved. Then pour over the cabbage mixture and toss until evenly coated. \*This dressing can be made ahead and stored in the fridge until you are ready to serve. If put the dressing on the salad and don't serve it right away then the noodles can become soggy\*.
