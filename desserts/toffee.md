### Ingredients

1 Cup Heavy Real Cream  
½ Cup Canned Cream (I use regular)  
¾ Cup Wh. Corn Syrup  
Dash of Salt  
½ Cup Packed Br. Sugar  
1 Cup Wh. Sugar  
½ tsp. Vanilla  
2 tbsp. Butter  

### Instructions

In a heavy sauce pan combine all ingredients (except vanilla and butter), add ¾ cup of the cream mixture.  
Bring to a boil over medium heat, stirring to dissolve the sugar.  
Cook to softball stage (234 Degrees), stirring occasionally.  
Very slowly add a little at a time the rest of the cream mixture so the syrup continues to boil.  
Cook to firm ball stage (244 Degrees), it may take 20 min or more.  
Remove from heat, stir in vanilla and butter.  
Place in a buttered “11x 15” pan to cool and cut.
