### Ingredients

* ¼ cup Crisco
* 2 egg whites or 3 tbsp Meringue (Never use butter)
* Bit of water
* 2-3 cups icing sugar
* Flavouring extract (Rum, Vanilla, almond etc..)

### Instructions

This is about enough for a cake. Make all white and add colours in individual bowls, always mix with knife, not spoon. This can be varied. Egg whites help to give body. Good for practising to make flowers. Add a few drops of water for borders so it flows better.
