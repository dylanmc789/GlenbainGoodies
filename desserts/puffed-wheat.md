* 1 cup Brown Sugar

### Instructions

In large bowl measure 10 cups of puffed wheat (I always start with 9 and if I need more I add the 10th cup). In saucepan put your butter, sugar, corn syrup, and dark cocoa. While stirring bring to a boil and boil for 2 minutes. Pour over puffed wheat and press into greased 9 x 13 pan and let cool before serving.
