### Ingredients

* 1 Pkg. Vanilla cake mix
* 1 Container of Cool Whip
* 2 Cups Strawberries (fresh or frozen)

Caramel Sauce:

* 1 Cup Butter
* 1 Cup Brown Sugar
* 1/4 Cup Corn Syrup
* 1 Cup Sweetened Condensed Milk

### Instructions

Make the vanilla cake according to the instructions on the box. Once cooked poke holes all over the cake, to allow caramel to soak in. To make the caramel sauce: Put butter, sugar, syrup, and milk into a heavy saucepan. Bring to a boil and cook for another 5 minutes stirring continually as it burns easily and quickly. Once the sauce is done pour over the baked cake and let it cool completely before topping with whipped cream and strawberries
