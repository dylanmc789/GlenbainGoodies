### Ingredients

For The Pastry Shells

* 1 Package frozen puff pastry (3 slabs)
* 1 Eggs white, lightly beaten
* Granulated sugar (for sprinkling)

For the Filling

* 2 cups (1 lb) butter or margarine, room temperature
* 8 Tbsp (1⁄2 cup) cream (heavy or table cream, adjust as needed)
* 3 cups powdered sugar (icing sugar)
* 2 Tbsp vanilla extract
* Optional: 1 tsp pure almond extract

For the Chocolate Dip

* 1 package Hershey’s milk chocolate
* 1 Tbsp coconut oil

### Instructions

**Prepare the Pastry Shells**

1. Preheat oven to 375°F (190°C).

2. Remove puff pastry from the freezer. Thaw until just soft enough to unroll without cracking (still cold but workable).

3. Cut each slab into 6–8 long ribbons.

4. Wrap each strip around a metal cream roll mold, slightly overlapping as you go. Tip: For bite-size rolls, cut strips in half and wrap from each end of the mold.

5. Place wrapped molds on a parchment-lined baking sheet sprayed lightly with cooking spray.

6. Brush tops with egg white and sprinkle with sugar.

7. Bake for 15–18 minutes (or at 365°F if your oven runs hot), until lightly golden brown.

8. Cool on wire racks before removing from molds.

**Make the Filling**

1. In a large mixing bowl, whip softened butter for 6 minutes until pale and fluffy.

2. Add half the cream and continue beating.

3. Slowly add the powdered sugar, then the remaining cream.

4. Beat until smooth, light, and pipeable. Adjust cream amount as needed (not too loose).

5. Mix in vanilla extract, and almond extract if desired.

**Make the Chocolate Dip**

1. Melt the chocolate with coconut oil until smooth.

2. Let cool slightly (so it thickens a bit and doesn’t run off the rolls).

**Assemble the Cream Rolls**

1. Pipe filling into cooled pastry shells.

2. Dip ends of rolls in melted chocolate.

3. Place on parchment paper until chocolate is set.

**Yield**

About 2 dozen cream rolls, more if made bite-sized.
