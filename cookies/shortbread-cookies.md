### Ingredients

* 2 cups butter
* 1 cup icing sugar
* ½ cup cornstarch
* 3 cups sifted flour
* ½ tsp. vanilla

### Instructions

Beat butter. Add remaining ingredients and continue to beat. Place the dough on a floured surface and knead in ½ cup flour. If using a cookie press bake them right away or you can form a roll, freeze and slice ¼ inch thick when needed. Bake for 15 minutes at 350°f or until very slightly browned. They should be pale.
