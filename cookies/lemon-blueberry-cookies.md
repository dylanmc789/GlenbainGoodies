* 1/2 Cup White Sugar
* Zest of 1 lemon
* 1 Cup unsalted butter
* 1/2 Cup Brown Sugar
* 1 3.4 oz package lemon or vanilla instant pudding mix
* 2 Eggs
* 1 Tsp. Vanilla extract

### Instructions

Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper or a Silicone baking mat and set aside. In a small bowl, rub the granulated sugar and lemon zest together, using your fingers, until fragrant. Using a mixer, beat together butter and sugars until creamy. Add in lemon pudding mix, eggs, and vanilla extract. In a medium bowl, whisk together the flour, baking soda, and salt. Add the dry ingredients to the wet ingredients and mix until just combined. Stir in the dried blueberries and white chocolate chips. Drop cookie dough by rounded tablespoons onto prepared baking sheet. Bake for 10 minutes, or until slightly golden around the edges and set. Remove cookies from oven and let cool on baking sheet for two minutes. Transfer to a cooling rack and cool completely. \* If you are using a Vanilla pudding mix instead of Lemon just add a 1/2 Tsp. of Lemon extract.\*
